    <center><h2>come here :kath</h2>
    here's a wind that blows in from the north<br>
    And it says that loving takes this course<br>
    Come here<br>
    Come here<br>
    No I'm not impossible to touch<br>
    I have never wanted you so much<br>
    Come here<br>
    Come here<br>
    Have I never laid down by your side<br>
    Baby let's forget about this pride<br>
    Come here<br>
    Come here<br>
    <br>
    Well I'm in no hurry<br>
    You don't have to run away this time<br>
    I know that you're timid<br>
    but it's gonna be all right this time<br>
    <br>
    There's a wind that blows in from the north<br>
    And it says that loving takes this course<br>
    Come here Come here<br>
    Come here Come here<br>
